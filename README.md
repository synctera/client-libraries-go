# Go API client for synctera

Let's build something great. Welcome to the public repository for client generation. The goal for this repository is to help you generate clients in the language of your choosing which we hope will make it even easier for you to work with our APIs.

If you have landed here before checking out our developer site - please start [here](https://dev.synctera.com) to learn more about our platform and concepts. Our suggestion is to start with the guides to get the high level view and then dig into the API reference to understand the details.

Our APIs are the best way to automate your company's banking needs and are designed to be easy to understand and implement. We're continuously growing this library and what you see here is just the start, but if you need something specific or have a question, please reach out to us at our [contact](https://www.synctera.com/contact) page.

## Overview

The Synctera API clients are generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-spec](https://www.openapis.org/) using the following steps you can generate your own fresh Synctera client library based on the latest copy of our OpenAPI spec. The [Go Documentation](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/go) for the generator is also quite useful.

## Steps to Generate

Here are the steps involved in generating your Go API client:

1. Get the latest copy of our API spec at `https://dev.synctera.com/reference/openapi-spec`
2. Download the spec and save it as something like `synctera-openapi.json`
3. Get the `openapi-generator-cli` - there are a few options here but if you are on MacOS you can just `brew install openapi-generator-cli` to get a recent copy. Currently we have tested generation with version `6.0.1` of the generator cli.
4. Generate:

```shell
openapi-generator-cli generate -i synctera_openapi.json -g go -o ./synctera_client --additional-properties=useOneOfDiscriminatorLookup=true,enumClassPrefix=true,packageName=synctera_client
```

5. Clean things up a bit in the client library directory:

```shell
cd <your client library directory>
goimports -w .
go mod tidy
```

A package generated based on these instructions has been included here within the `synctera_client` directory - this is a point in time generated client. We recommend generating your own and going forward we will likely stop generating these example artifacts.
